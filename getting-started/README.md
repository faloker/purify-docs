# Getting Started

## Architecture

The hierarchy of Purify is simple: 

1. **Project** - the root component, can be a dedicated software project or a roaster of team projects
2. **Unit** - the direct child of a project, may represent releases, sub-projects, or any other type of separation that makes sense to you
3. **Report** - belong to a unit
4. **Template** - attached to a report and used to parse issues
5. **Issue** - extracted from a report and formatted based on a template

## Play with it

There is a [demo instance of Purify](https://purify-demo.herokuapp.com), feel free to play with it. This instance contains enough data to take a look at all the basic functions of Purify.
