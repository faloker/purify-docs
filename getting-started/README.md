# Getting Started

## Architecture

The hierarchy of Purify is simple: 

1. Project \(the root component\) 
2. Units \(the direct child of a project\) 
3. Reports \(belong to a unit\) 
4. Templates \(attached to a report and used to parse issues\) 
5. Issues \(extracted from a report and formatted based on a template\)

## Play with it

There is a [demo instance of Purify](https://purify-demo.herokuapp.com), feel free to play with it. This instance contains enough data to take a look at all the basic functions of Purify.

You can find reports samples [here](../report-samples.md).
