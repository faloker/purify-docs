# Purify

## [Demo](https://purify-demo.herokuapp.com/)

## Why

The goal of Purify to be an easy-in-use and efficient tool to simplify a workflow of managing vulnerabilities delivered from various tools.

Purify is designed to analyze the report of **any tool**, if the report is in JSON or XML format. This means you don't need any special plug-ins to process reports from your selection of tools.

Collect all security findings in one place, review/validate/track them, collaborate, get notifications, export them into tracking systems \(e.g. Jira\) and so on.

## Getting Started

At the moment, the project is under development and much can change.

To start with the tool first thing you need is a report from another tool. Let's say you have to analyze your project with [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks).

Because it is first time, you need to analyze all commits and it can be thousands of them. But you got a report and it is full of findings, and a lof of them a duplicate, because one secret may appear in multiple commits. Here is where Purify can help you.

The logic hierarchy of Purify is simple: 1. Project \(the root component\) 1. Units \(the direct child of a project\) 1. Reports \(belong to a unit\) 1. Templates \(attached to a report and used to parse issues\) 1. Issues \(extracted from a report and formatted based on a template\)

To upload a report \(assumed that you already created a project and unit\) you need a token:

```text
http POST https://purifyhost/api/auth/token username="user" password="pass"
```

Now you can upload a report

```text
http -f POST https://purifyhost/api/reports "apikey: token" "unit=gitleaks-test" file@/path/to/gitleaks-report.json
```

If you already created a template for such tool, you need to provide it, so report content will be parsed automatically

```text
http -f POST https://purifyhost/api/reports "apikey: token" "unit=gitleaks-test" "template=gitleaks" file@/path/to/gitleaks-report.json
```

## Deployment

Before deployment you may want to configure a few things in config files:

**Docker**

```text
// purify/docker-compose.yml

// use local database if needed
mongo:
...
environment:
  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example


// update local path to the .env file (see api/.env.example)
api:
...
env_file:
  - .env.custom


// update local paths to certificate and key files
// update entities in nginx config file nginx.prod.conf (server_name at least)
nginx:
...
volumes:
      - /path/to/cert:/etc/nginx/ssl/cert
      - /path/to/key:/etc/nginx/ssl/key
      - ./nginx.prod.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

To start them all

```text
docker-compose up -d
```
